\title{Abstracts (encoding and decoding of text files){}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We have made a program that encodes a text file per line into numbers, whilst keeping special character intact. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Encoding}
After the user has chosen a file, they have the option to process it and save the encoded file as a text file and save the index file. The index file is a CSV-file in which the translation (corresponding letters to the words), frequency of the words within the whole file and the amount of times a word appears in a line (abstract) is written. When it encodes a file it does it by reading the text file line by line. Each different word gets a different number assigned to it so if a word appears multiple times in a file it has the same number assigned to it. It also creates a textual histogram of the amount of times a word begins with a certain letter.

\section{Decoding}
Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to program a decoder and it also doesnâ€™t calculate the TF/IDF-scores of a line. 

\section{Source code listing}
Below you will find the listing of our program. We have tried to use the suggestions in the assigneme
